This project was very eye-opening for me. It showed me all the amazing things that can be done with vanilla JavaScript and the reason we'd want to use web frameworks. It was cool to write a functional web application using purely JavaScript and Html, but it would have been much much faster and easier to use a front-end framework. However, I'm glad I got the chance to do this because I now have the tools necessary to make quick changes to a website if I need to without using a big clunky framework. 

I feel like the website could be more polished and there could be more features, but I'm deciding to call it good here because 
1. Coding is never finished (as Dilbert says) and I don't think I'll ever feel like there's nothing else I could add on to it.
2. It's Monday night and my wife is scheduled to be induced to have a baby at 6:15 tomorrow morning, so I am in a bit of a time crunch at the moment.
